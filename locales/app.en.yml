      Hi, I am %{name}. My task is to greet people and remind events.
      I was created to take some weight off who handled this job before me.

      I support these commands:

      /start - starts the event reminder

      /stop - stops the event reminder

      /status - checks the event reminder status

      /version - displays information about me

      /help - displays this message

    version: |
      %{name} %{version}
      Running on branch <i>%{branch_name}</i>.
      Code on <a href="%{remote_repo}">github.com</a>.
